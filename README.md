# Scoring Playground

_Are you sick of seeing those three `P`s on top of the scoreboard?_

_Do you think the challenges scores were dropping too fast, and that
caused stress and frustration in your team members - leading to an
unhealthy consumption of alcoholic beverages?_

_Do you know, deep down, that if you could have just changed a tiny
parameter of the scoring algorithm you could now have been on your way to
Vegas, wearing a tuxedo, ready to sign authographs on the Defcon red carpet?_

We hear your complains. 
So, now go ahead and customize the scoring system the way you prefer.
